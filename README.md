# COSC600-Introduction to Programming 1

  - Learn concepts used in programming. Create programs that use variables, allow for user input and output, and provide opportunities for simple decision strategies.
  - Learn how to work with different variable types and how to debug programs. 
  - In addition, create and use strategies that involve repetition (looping) in your programs. 
  - Create methods and work with elementary data.

### Course Description: 
  In Introduction to Programming I, you will learn concepts used in programming. You will create programs that use variables, allow for user input and output, and provide opportunities for simple decision strategies. You will also learn how to work with different variable types and how to debug programs. In addition, you will create and use strategies that involve repetition (looping) in your programs. You will create methods and work with elementary data. This course leads directly into the second course COSC 601 - Introduction to Programming II.
